By closely monitoring the “A” items, a company is able to manage the most important items with a relatively small effort."

Examples include cash, investments, accounts receivable, inventory, supplies, land, buildings, equipment, and vehicles. Assets are reported on the balance sheet usually at cost or lower. Assets are also part of the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s (Stockholders’) Equity. Some valuable items that cannot be measured and expressed in dollars include the company’s outstanding reputation, its customer base, the value of successful consumer brands, and its management team. As a result these items are not reported among the assets appearing on the balance sheet."
